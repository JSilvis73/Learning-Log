Topic: Microsoft ASP.NET Core Identity

🆔 What I Learned: ASP.NET Core Identity (Authentication System)
✅ Overview
ASP.NET Core Identity is Microsoft’s built-in authentication & user management system.

Provides secure and extensible tools to register, login, manage roles, and handle claims-based authorization.

🧱 Core Concepts
Term	Meaning
IdentityUser	Built-in user class (can be extended)
IdentityRole	Represents roles like “Admin”, “User”
UserManager	Service for creating & managing users
SignInManager	Service for login/logout/sign-in flows
RoleManager	Create, delete, assign roles
ApplicationDbContext	EF DbContext that includes all Identity tables

🗃️ Default Identity Tables (via EF Core)
AspNetUsers – Users & credentials

AspNetRoles – Role definitions

AspNetUserRoles – Maps users to roles

AspNetUserClaims – Claim-based permissions

AspNetUserTokens – Password reset, 2FA, etc.

🔐 Security Built In
Passwords are hashed and never stored as plain text.

Middleware handles auth checks with User.IsInRole(), [Authorize], or policies.

You can customize the user model if needed (e.g. extend IdentityUser).

⚙️ Setup Flow (Summarized)
Add Identity & EF Core NuGet packages

Configure services in Program.cs

Add ApplicationDbContext that inherits IdentityDbContext

Add authentication middleware

Create/Register/Login users using UserManager and SignInManager

💡 Notes to Self
Identity integrates naturally with EF Core — good fit for my MyPAS project.

Can scale from cookie-based auth to token-based APIs (JWT).

May want to scaffold or API-wrap Identity instead of Razor Pages since I’m using React frontend.

🔍 Next Steps
✅ Add Identity packages to backend

✅ Plan user model + login/register endpoints

🔜 Secure API with [Authorize]

🔜 Research token vs. cookie auth for SPA

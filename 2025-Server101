# On a deep dive about computers figured this would be a good place to start storing notes for use.

This section will cover servers, what they are, what they do and more. It is a quick sheet.

What is a server?
  Geeks for Geeks would describe it as "A server is a hardware device or software that processes requests sent over a network and replies to them. 
  A client is the device that submits a request and waits for a response from the server."

  A server can be:
    A software program setup to handle responses.
    A physical device.

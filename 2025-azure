# ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Fundamentals ‚Äì Core Architectural Components (Learning Log)

Module: [Describe core architectural components of Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-core-architectural-components-of-azure)

---

## üèóÔ∏è Core Components of Azure Architecture

### 1. **Regions**
- Geographical areas with one or more datacenters.
- Examples: East US, West Europe, Southeast Asia.
- Important for **latency**, **compliance**, and **redundancy**.

### 2. **Availability Zones**
- Physically separate locations within a region.
- Provide high availability through isolation.
- Used for mission-critical apps that need **99.99% uptime**.

### 3. **Resource Groups**
- Logical containers for grouping related resources.
- Resources in a group share the same lifecycle (create, update, delete together).
- Helps organize and manage billing, access, and deployment.

### 4. **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**
- Deployment and management layer.
- Manages infrastructure through templates and declarative configuration.
- Supports **RBAC**, tagging, and **template-based deployments** (Bicep, ARM templates).

---

## üß± Azure Compute Options

### 1. **Virtual Machines (VMs)**
- Windows/Linux-based VMs.
- Full control over OS and runtime.
- Scales manually or via VM scale sets.

### 2. **App Services**
- PaaS for hosting web apps, REST APIs.
- Handles scaling, patching, and high availability automatically.

### 3. **Azure Functions**
- Serverless compute; event-driven.
- Great for background jobs, APIs, and automation.

---

## üì¶ Azure Networking Components

### 1. **Virtual Network (VNet)**
- Private network space in Azure.
- Similar to traditional on-prem networking.
- Supports subnets, routing, firewalls, peering.

### 2. **Load Balancer**
- Distributes traffic across multiple VMs.
- Layer 4 (TCP/UDP).

### 3. **Application Gateway**
- Layer 7 load balancer.
- Supports SSL termination, WAF (Web Application Firewall), path-based routing.

### 4. **VPN Gateway & ExpressRoute**
- Secure connections between Azure and on-prem environments.
- VPN uses public internet; ExpressRoute uses private connection.

| Component         | Purpose                             |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Region           | Location of your resources          |
| Availability Zone| Redundancy within region            |
| Resource Group   | Logical grouping of resources       |
| ARM              | Management/deployment layer         |
| VM / App Service | Compute options                     |
| VNet / Gateway   | Networking and secure connections   |

Azure Fundamentals ‚Äì Describe Azure Compute and Networking Services

**Module Completed:** Describe Azure compute and networking services  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Passed  
**Achievement:** Badge earned

---

### üß† Concepts Learned

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Compute Services
- **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs):** Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) option for full OS control.
- **Azure App Service:** Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) hosting for web apps and APIs, including autoscaling, deployment slots, and CI/CD support.
- **Azure Functions:** Serverless compute, event-driven, great for lightweight or background tasks.
- **Azure Container Instances (ACI):** Quick, simple container deployment without managing infrastructure.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** Full container orchestration for large-scale applications using Kubernetes.

#### üåê Networking Services
- **Virtual Network (VNet):** A private network space within Azure, enabling secure communication between resources.
- **VPN Gateway:** Provides secure, encrypted connections between on-prem and Azure VNets.
- **ExpressRoute:** Private, high-speed connection from on-prem to Azure (bypasses public internet).
- **Load Balancer:** Layer 4 traffic distribution (TCP/UDP), great for high availability.
- **Application Gateway:** Layer 7 traffic management, with support for SSL termination and web application firewall (WAF).
- **Azure DNS:** Provides ultra-fast, secure domain name resolution.

üíæ Azure Fundamentals ‚Äì Describe Azure Storage Services
Module Completed: Describe Azure storage services
Status: ‚úÖ Module assessment passed
Achievement: Badge earned

üìò Concepts Covered
üì¶ Azure Storage Types
Blob Storage
Stores unstructured data like images, videos, documents, backups.
Optimized for large amounts of data.
Tiers: Hot, Cool, Archive.

Disk Storage
Used with Azure VMs for OS and data disks.
High-performance SSD and HDD options.

File Storage
Fully managed file shares using SMB protocol.
Supports lift-and-shift scenarios, and on-prem integration.

Queue Storage
Messaging store for reliable asynchronous communication between components.

Table Storage
NoSQL key-value store for structured data.
Good for large-scale data with fast access needs.

üîê Storage Access & Security
Shared Access Signature (SAS):
Provides delegated, time-limited access to storage resources.

Storage Account Keys:
Primary and secondary keys provide full access ‚Äî should be rotated regularly.

Azure AD Integration:
Modern, role-based access via Azure Active Directory.

üîÑ Redundancy & Replication Options
LRS (Locally Redundant Storage)
Replicates data within a single datacenter.

GRS (Geo-Redundant Storage)
Replicates across regions for disaster recovery.

ZRS (Zone-Redundant Storage)
Replicates across availability zones in one region.

üß† Summary Table
Storage Type	Purpose	Use Case
Blob Storage	Unstructured data	Images, videos, backups
File Storage	SMB-compatible file shares	Lift-and-shift apps, shared files
Queue Storage	Async messaging	Decoupled systems, event-driven
Table Storage	NoSQL structured data	Key-value lookups, large datasets
Disk Storage	VM disks	OS, temp, and data disks

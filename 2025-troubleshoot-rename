## ðŸ”„ Renaming a .NET Project (e.g., MyMed â†’ MyPAS)

### Date: June 18, 2025

I had to rename my project from `MyMed` to `MyPAS`. Here's what I learned and how I did it cleanly.

### âœ… Steps:
1. **Find and Replace All References**
   - Searched for `MyMed` and replaced with `MyPAS` across the entire backend project.

2. **Rename Files and Folders**
   - Renamed all files containing `MyMed` in the name (e.g., `MyMedContext.cs` â†’ `MyPASContext.cs`)
   - Renamed the `.csproj` file and folder (e.g., `MyMed-Backend.csproj` â†’ `MyPAS-Backend.csproj`)

3. **Update Solution File**
   - Removed the old project from the solution.
   - Added the renamed project back to the solution.

4. **Rebuild Project**
   ```bash
   dotnet clean
   dotnet build

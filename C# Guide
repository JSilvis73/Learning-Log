Review of Concepts

C# fundamentals: classes, constructors, static vs instance, immutability

Class is a blueprint for creating objects that hold state and behavior.

  Ex: 
    class Player
  {
    public string Name;
    public int HP;

    public void Attack() {}
  }

When we instantiate a class they are seperate from eachother unless we use the word static.
  var p1 = new Player();
  var p2 = new Player();

Constructor is a way to ensure the classes start off in a valid state. This is where you valisate the parameters of the class.
Such as ensuring name is not null, or a field that is important has the information it needs.

    Class Player
  { 
    public int Id {get;}
    public string Name {get;}

    public Player(int id, string name)
    {
      if (id < 0) throw new arguementException();
      if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(name)) throw new ArguementException();

      Id = id;
      Name = name;
    }
  }

Static Vs Instance

Static - Shared between all instances of a class.

In a class the fields like public int HP would be only to the instance of the class. So every player created has their own HP.
If the field has static in it such as public static int MaxPlayers = 100; That means that all instances of the class share that field.
This can be used for ids to keep a track via class, but ids are best controlled in the service.

Immutability
 An object or part of an object that can not be changed after construction.

Ex: public int Id {get;}
This examples shows immutability at play. The Id field can not be changed after it is constructed or set even before. It can only be recieved.

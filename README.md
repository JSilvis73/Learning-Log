Jason's Learning Log 

Welcome to my learning log! I'm currently focused on:

- Building **MyMed**, a C#/.NET patient accounting system
- Learning **Azure** via Microsoft Learn
- Rebuilding my **portfolio site** with React
- Preparing to apply for software development roles at companies like Microsoft

This repo is where I track my journey, progress, and notes.
